      <h2>A bit more about me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a DevOps lead with a passion for creating efficient, scalable
        systems and improving developer experiences. With over 9 years in
        software engineering, I've worked across the stack but found my true
        calling in DevOps and technical leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently based in Manhattan, I lead DevOps transformation efforts at
        NCR Voyix, where I focus on implementing automated workflows,
        standardized environments, and metric-driven improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding or automating processes, you can find me cycling
        around the city, experimenting with photography, or diving into the
        latest developments in AI and machine learning.
